# TinyServe

A from-scratch LLM inference engine for a single small GPU (NVIDIA T4, 16 GB, Turing).
Target model: Qwen3-0.6B. Written to be read and understood, not to compete with vLLM.

> Status: **M1, forward pass.** Config parsing works; no inference yet. See [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md).

## Planned features

1. Model forward pass loaded from safetensors (Hugging Face used only as a test reference)
2. Paged KV cache with a block allocator
3. Continuous-batching scheduler with preemption
4. Radix-tree prefix cache with LRU eviction
5. Custom Triton paged decode-attention kernel
6. Batched sampling and an OpenAI-compatible streaming endpoint

## Quickstart (development)

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install          # run ruff and mypy on every commit
ruff check . && ruff format --check . && mypy && pytest
```

## Benchmarks

None yet. Every number here will come from a logged run with date and hardware.

## How it's tested

- CPU tests run in GitHub Actions on Python 3.11, 3.12 and 3.14 on every push; the job fails if
  any test fails. The same lint and type checks run locally as a pre-commit hook.
- GPU tests are marked `@pytest.mark.gpu` and run on a Kaggle/Colab T4.

## Limitations

- Single GPU only. No tensor parallelism, no quantization, not for deployment.
- Only Qwen3 dense checkpoints are supported; other architectures are rejected at load time.
- No inference yet.

## Prior art

vLLM (PagedAttention, SOSP 2023), nano-vllm, Mini-SGLang.
